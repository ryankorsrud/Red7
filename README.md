### How to use / Rules

After chosing the number of players(including yourself as a player) and times you want to shuffle, each player will be dealt 7 cards to their hand and one card to their palette. In your turn players add one card to their palette and can choose if they would like to play a card to change the rule. If at the end of their turn, the player isn't winning according to the current rule they are out. If a player has no cards to play on their turn they are also out. The player next to the player with the highest card will always start each game.
